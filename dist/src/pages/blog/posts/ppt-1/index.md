# I (accidentally) beat Puyo Puyo Tetris
2024-11-03
## Intro
So i decided to buy it, seeing that it was like $3 on steam!!!

## My experience

It was pretty good!! i still have to 100% the adventure and stuff but i've at least finished the any%

My playtime is not accurate because i played the 3ds version at some moment in time but steam says it took [around 7 hours](/assets/blog/ppt-1/steam-playtime.png) (including online)

As i am (sadly) a tetris main, i destroyed the things where you play tetris and got destroyed on the things where you play with puyos (man i really want to get good at puyo)

As for the "accidental" clear it's because i thought there was a chapter 8 based on the clear % (it was on 93%), so when i finished 7-10 the [Historian achievement told me something](/assets/blog/ppt-1/stream-chat.png)

Since i'm still at 14/42 achievements i still have a long way to go, and [i sure](/assets/blog/ppt-1/steam-cleaner.png) [need to](/assets/blog/ppt-1/steam-chain.png) gamble on some achievements (puzzle league too!!)

Pretty good game! I will keep playing it
