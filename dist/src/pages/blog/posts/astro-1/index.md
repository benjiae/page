# Rewrite number i forgot: Astro time
ok so the older site's css actually sucked and i did it on a simpler way

## Why astro?

idk I wanted to try it for a while and i kept saying i'll do it later until now

It took a while to get my brain going because the default template made it 3 times more confusing, so i used the empty one after that, but once i got going it was surprisingly easy

## How
ok so first i tried using the .astro files for everything, until i remembered that i could do markdown files for the normal pages, which then turns out [I could also just use `.mdx` files and get the simplicity of markdown and the things from astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) (which is pretty cool!!)

## Experience

It was pretty nice!! [The documentation](https://docs.astro.build) (and the [blog tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/)) was really helpful compared to other things, i guess the experience from other SSGs also helped

## Conclusion
Astro might be overkill for this site, but i had fun writing this site and that's what matters, [here's the screenshot](/assets/blog/astro-1/screenshot.png), and bye!!
