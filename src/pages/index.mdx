Welcome to my site! i'm [benjae](#about) (more information below), and this is the product of me bruteforcing css over and over again
</div>

<div class="section" id="about">
# about me!!! <small><a href="#about">#</a></small>
As the text above says, i'm indeed a real person (wow!), specifically, a random [guy](https://pronouns.cc/@benjae) on the internet that likes some stuff, such as:
<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; gap: 1em;">
    <img src="/assets/images/niko.webp" width="128" height="128" alt="Niko from oneshot, a human-like figure with cat ears, purple hair, blue scarf and a brown overcoat putting a green hat on themselves"></img> Art by [Argon](https://bsky.app/profile/argoncrystal.bsky.social/post/3ltxbfyagik2d)!
    - Niko from [OneShot](https://store.steampowered.com/app/420530/OneShot/)!! (the thing on the left) they're so cool ~~i wish i looked like that~~
    - uhh playing games sometimes idk, i [speedran](https://www.speedrun.com/users/benjae) some stuff and have like 199 berries in [Celeste](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/), i play rhythm games too sometimes (including iidx)
    - fucking around on computers! (most of the time) that's how this site was made afterall ~~(with a lot of pain aswell)~~
</div>
</div>

<div class="section" id="buttons">
# Buttons! <small><a href="#buttons">#</a></small>
- My button!!
<Button image="/assets/buttons/benjae.png" alt="Ben" /> <textarea style="max-width: 40em; margin-left: 1em;"><a href="https://sillydomain.name"><img src="https://sillydomain.name/assets/buttons/benjae.png"></img></a></textarea>
<details>
<summary>Friends!! or cool creatures generally</summary>
<Buttons />

<summary>Cool things!</summary>
<Button image="/assets/buttons/misc/elwiwi.png" alt="el wiwi" /> {/* I don't know the image's source but it's all over internet so i just put a 88x31 frame, el wiwi */}
<Button image="/assets/buttons/misc/miku.gif" alt="This site is Miku approved" />
<ButtonLink image="/assets/buttons/misc/ezgif2.gif" alt="Swatch" href="https://deltarune.wiki/w/Swatch" />

</details>

<small>Most of these were grabbed from [The 88x31 GIF Collection](https://cyber.dabamos.de/88x31/), the ones that aren't have a comment in this site's [index.mdx](https://codeberg.org/benjae/pages/src/branch/main/src/pages/index.mdx)</small><br />
<small>The click here button's css is basically stolen from [lyra's blogpost](https://lyra.horse/blog/2025/08/you-dont-need-js/), the idea was just too silly to not do it</small>

this site is (half-jokingly) plagiarized from [natalie](https://mocha.pages.gay/) (but it's ok because i have [permission](/assets/images/plagiarism.webp) to do so), using stuff from:
- [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com), particularly Mocha and Latte
- [Atkinson Hyperlegible Next](https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/), it's a pretty cool font!
- [Astro](https://astro.build), idk i got used to it
