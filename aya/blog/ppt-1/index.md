## Intro
So i decided to buy it, seeing that it was like $3 on steam!!!

## My experience

It was pretty good!! i still have to 100% the adventure and stuff but i've at least finished the any%

My playtime is not accurate because i played the 3ds version at some moment in time but steam says it took [around 7 hours](steam-playtime.png) (including online)

As i am (sadly) a tetris main, i destroyed the things where you play tetris and got destroyed on the things where you play with puyos (man i really want to get good at puyo)

As for the "accidental" clear it's because i thought there was a chapter 8 based on the clear % (it was on 93%), so when i finished 7-10 the [Historian achievement told me something](stream-chat.png)

Since i'm still at 14/42 achievements i still have a long way to go, and [i sure](steam-cleaner.png) [need to](steam-chain.png)) gamble on some achievements (puzzle league too!!)

Pretty good game! I will keep playing it
